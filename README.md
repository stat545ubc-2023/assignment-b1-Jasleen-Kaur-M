Hi all!

This is the readmme file for my STATS class part 2.

You will see my create exciting new things in R and updating the readme file accordingly.

## Overview

Welcome to your (maybe) function creating project! This repository is part of the STAT 545B course, and it's dedicated to "Making a function" assignment. Get ready to learn how to write a function, work with 'roxygen2 tags` and working with `test_that` package; yes get to test your code. 🚀

## How to Engage with the Repository 🤝

If you've landed here, you're ready to dive into the initial R journey. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Assignment B1**: In this repository, you'll find everything you need for create your function assignment. We've already chosen a dataset, explored it, and defined research questions. It's all in the previous repositories.

2. **Project Structure**: The repository is structured according to the project tasks. This README is your guide to everything within.

3. **Chosen Dataset**: We've selected the 📋 "cancer_sample" dataset for this analysis. It's got potential for exciting discoveries!😉💥 (There is no restriciton on the dataset but an taking an example never hurts 😉)

## Files in this assignment repository:

1. Readme file: This file where you are currently 😅
2. The Rmd file: Where my code for the entire assignment exists with detailed instructions.
3. The md file: This is the knit document for you of my rmd file. Feel free to go through and look at the outputs.

## Conclusion 📝

This project showcases the use of R programming as tool for creating a function that can be used for quick analysis and modeling, with a focus on `cancer_sample` dataset from the `datateachr` package. The output can be tested using the `test_that` package.

Feel free to explore the code and output files to gain a deeper understanding of the analysis process and results.
