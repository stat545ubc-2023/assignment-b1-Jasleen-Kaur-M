```{r setup, include=FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(testthat)
```

Before we create a function, we need a dataset. For this project we will work with the `cancer_sample` dataset from `datateachr` package, since we explored the dataset previously.

First we load the `cancer_sample` dataset by loading the `datateachr` package as follows:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(datateachr)
```

Now before we begin with the main task, lets quickly explore the dataset, to understand it. We will use some basic `dplyr` functions to understand and explore the dataset.

```{r}
cancer_sample %>% 
  glimpse()
```
Now, while the `glimpse` function showed that there are 562 rows and 32 columns, we are not interested with working with all the columns. So we shall select a few to work with.
